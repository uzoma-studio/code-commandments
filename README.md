# &lt;uzoma.studio 10 code commandments>

1. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY your code). Make sure you only use a block of code once; if you need it again then encapsulate it in a function or component.
2. Create single-use components. If your component is doing more than one thing then you might want to refactor it.
3. Name variables carefully so you and your collaborators have a clear idea of what they do or are for.
4. Aim to write just the right amount of code needed to get the job done.
5. Use comments to explain what your code does.
